ViewMachine
===========

### Update

__VM is now a Stand-Alone Library__

While jQuery can still be used in conjunction with ViewMachine, an executive decision was made to remove an unnecessary depency, so that users can keep dependencies to a minimum.

Using VM enables you to keep your entire codebase in Javascript, rather than using HTML templating systems, or derivatives.

Please use, fork, improve and submit a pull request if you want to contribute. All contributions welcome.

### Contributing to the Project

Devlopers and Users of Latest Branch, there are a bunch of new types. Documentation is not completed, but has begun, as we move towards version 0.1.x

**The latest Documentation is available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/SamMorrowDrums/ViewMachine/wiki)**


The original documentation has been removed, as the current branch contains none of the original code, and it has been permenantly depricated.
