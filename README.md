ViewMachine
===========

### New structure

___VM is currently undergoing the following changes:___

* Using more of the built-in methods for DOM interaction
* Building with requireJS instead of Concat
* Restructuring organiztion of source files
* Tests need to be added
* Documentation needs to be written once final decisions have been made
* 

Using VM enables you to keep your entire codebase in Javascript, rather than using HTML templating systems, or derivatives.

Please use, fork, improve and submit a pull request if you want to contribute. All contributions welcome.

### Contributing to the Project

Devlopers and Users of Latest Branch, there are a bunch of new types. Documentation is not completed, but has begun, as we move towards version 0.1.x

**The latest Documentation is available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/SamMorrowDrums/ViewMachine/wiki)**


The original documentation has been removed, as the current branch contains none of the original code, and it has been permenantly depricated.
