### New structure

___VM is currently undergoing the following changes:___

* Using more of the built-in methods for DOM interaction
* Cleaning up source since move to r.js
* Tests need to be added
* Documentation needs to be written once final decisions have been made

Using VM enables you to keep your entire codebase in Javascript, rather than using HTML templating systems, or derivatives.

Please use, fork, improve and submit a pull request if you want to contribute. All contributions welcome.
